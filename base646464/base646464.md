# base646464

This is a relatively straight forward challenge with the name giving away what needs to be done. The two files provided are *cipher.txt* which contains the ciphertext as a long string encoded to base64 and `generate.js` which contains the javascript code that performs the encryption.

The code provided is:
```javascript
const btoa = str => Buffer.from(str).toString('base64');

const fs = require("fs");
const flag = fs.readFileSync("flag.txt", "utf8").trim();

let ret = flag;
for(let i = 0; i < 25; i++) ret = btoa(ret);

fs.writeFileSync("cipher.txt", ret);
```
It is clear from the `for` loop that the plaintext gets encoded to base64 25 times. Therefore to reverse this we simplely need to base64 decode the string 25 time to retrieve the flag.

The following Python code performs the decryption:
```python
import base64

with open('cipher.txt', 'r') as f:
    ciphertext = f.readline()

for i in range(25):
    ciphertext = base64.b64decode(ciphertext)

print(ciphertext)
```
The flag is `flag{l00ks_l1ke_a_l0t_of_64s}`
